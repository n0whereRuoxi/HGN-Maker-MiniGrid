The files in this directory consist of those that should be necessary to reproduce the Blocks World domain results published in "Learning Methods to Generate Good Plans: Integrating HTN Learning and Reinforcement Learning" by Chad Hogg, Ugur Kuter, and Hector Munoz-Avila published in Proceedings of the Twenty-Fourth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-10).

The individual files are as follows:


#### Used for the Q-Maker step ####

`domain_strips.pddl` - A classical representation of the Blocks World domain, formatted for use by HTN-Maker and related programs.

`domain_ff.pddl` - A classical representation of the Blocks World domain, formatted for use with the FastForward planner.

`tasks.pddl` - A set of annotated tasks for the Blocks World domain, formatted for use by HTN-Maker and related programs.

`domain_empty.htn` - An HTN representation of the Blocks World domain but without any non-trivial methods, formatted for use by HTN-Maker and related programs.

`raw_probs/*.raw_prob` - A set of 800 classical planning problems in the Blocks World domain, formatted for use by the FastForward planner.

`plans/*_ff.output` - A solution to the associated problem in `raw_probs/`, generated by the FastForward planner.

`plans/*_htn-maker.input` - A solution to the associated problem in `raw_probs/', generated by the FastForward planner but then formatted for use by HTN-Maker and related programs.

`qmaker_problem_order.txt` - An ordered list of 600 problem IDs.

`qmaker_output/*_domain.htn` - An HTN representation of the Blocks World domain with methods learned from the associated problem in `raw_probs/` and all problems that precede it in `qmaker_problem_order.txt`.  The algorithm for producing each of these is as follows:
    `cp domain_empty.htn qmaker_output/current_domain.htn`
    `for $ID in qmaker_problem_order do`
        `htn-maker --qvalues --drop_unneeded --force_ops_first --only_task_effects --require_new --soundness_check domain_strips.pddl tasks.pddl raw_probs/$ID.raw_prob plans/$ID_htn-maker.input qmaker_output/current_domain.htn > qmaker_output/$ID_domain.htn`
        `cp qmaker_output/$ID_domain.htn qmaker_output/current_domain.htn`


#### Used for the Q-Reinforce step ####

`phase2_htn_probs/*.htn_prob` - A set of 800 HTN planning problems in the Blocks World domain, formatted for use by HTN-Maker and related programs.  Any overlap between these and the problems in `raw_probs/` is strictly coincidental.

`htn_domain_phase1.pddl` - A copy of `qmaker_results/current_domain.htn` after all problems had been processed.

`htn_domain_novalues.pddl` - A copy of `htn_domain_original.pddl` from which all Q-value information has been stripped.

`qreinforce_output/*_domain.htn` - The `htn_domain_original.pddl` file after being run through the associated problem in `phase2_htn_probs/` and all before it in numerical order.  The algorithm for producing these is as follows:
    `cp htn_domain_phase1.pddl qreinforce_output/current_domain.htn`
    `for $ID = 000 to 799 do`
        `htn-solver2 --use_qvalues --update_qvalues --random_selection qreinforce_output/current_domain.htn phase2_htn_probs/$ID.htn_prob > qreinforce_output/$ID_domain.htn`
        `cp qreinforce_output/$ID_domain.htn qreinforce_output/current_domain.htn`

`htn_domain_phase2.pddl` - A copy of `qreinforce_output/current_domain.htn` after all problems had been processed.


#### Used for the Q-SHOP step ####

`phase3_raw_probs/*.strips_prob` - A set of 420 classical planning problems in the Blocks World domain, formatted for use by FastForward and SGPlan6.  Any overlap between these problems and those in `raw_probs/` and `phase2_htn_probs/` is strictly coincidental.  There are 20 problems each of size 4 to 44.

`phase3_htn_probs/*.htn_prob` - The HTN planning problems equivalent to the files in `phase3_raw_probs/`.

`ff_output/*_ff.output` - A plan generated by running FastForward with `domain_strips.pddl` and the appropriate problem file in `phase3_raw_probs/`.

`sgplan_output/*_sgplan.output` - A plan generated by running SGPlan6 with `domain_strips.pddl` and the appropriate problem file in `phase3_raw_probs/`.

`shop_output/*_novalues.output` - A plan generated by running `htn-solver2` with no options, `htn_domain_novalues.pddl`, and the appropriate problem file in `phase3_htn_probs/`.

`phase1_output/*_phase1.output` - A plan generated by running `htn-solver2` with the `--use_qvalues` option, `htn_domain_phase1.pddl`, and the appropriate problem file in `phase3_htn_probs/`.

`phase2_output/*_phase2.output` - A plan generated by running `htn-solver2` with the `--use_qvalues` option, `htn_domain_phase2.pddl`, and the appropriate problem file in `phase3_htn_probs/`.
